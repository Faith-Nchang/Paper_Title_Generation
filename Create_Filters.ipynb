      "Accurate 3D object detection from point clouds has become a crucial component in autonomous driving. However, the volumetric representations and the projection methods in previous works fail to establish the relationships between the local point sets. In this paper, we propose Sparse Voxel-Graph Attention Network (SVGA-Net), a novel end-to-end trainable network which mainly contains voxel-graph module and sparse-to-dense regression module to achieve comparable 3D detection tasks from raw LIDAR data. Specifically, SVGA-Net constructs the local complete graph within each divided 3D spherical voxel and global KNN graph through all voxels. The local and global graphs serve as the attention mechanism to enhance the extracted features. In addition, the novel sparse-to-dense regression module enhances the 3D box estimation accuracy through feature maps aggregation at different levels. Experiments on KITTI detection benchmark and Waymo Open dataset demonstrate the efficiency of extending the graph representation to 3D object detection and the proposed SVGA-Net can achieve decent detection accuracy.\n",

We introduce graph representation to process point clouds. By constructing a local complete graph in the divided spherical voxel space, we can get a better local representation of the point feature, and the information between the point and its neighborhood can be fused. By constructing a global graph, we can better supervise and learn the features of points. In addition, the sparse-to-dense regression module can also fuse feature maps at different scales. Experiments have demonstrated the efficiency of the design choice in our network. Future work will extend SVGA-Net to combine RGB images to further improve detection accuracy. \n"
